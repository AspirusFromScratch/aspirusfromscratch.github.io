		<h3>Welcome to my website</h3>
		<p>Hello and thanks for stopping by my little space on the internet. You can check out the games and stuff I made on this website. On the Tools page I have also created various useful tools you might find a use for when creating scratch projects.</p>
		<h3>What I am working on</h3>
		<p>I am currently working on a scratch font injector project, where you can convert a .ttf font into a sequence of .svg images which then can be used in the font renderer on scratch. The font injector will be available on the Tools page after I have developed it.</p>
		<h3>What do I do</h3>
		<p>I am currently studying in high-school. I am going to study computer-science after high-school and study computer science further. I can code in Python, JavaScript and Scratch!</p>
		<h3>You might also like</h3>
		<p>I have a YouTube channel where I upload tutorial videos and insights of my projects.</p>
